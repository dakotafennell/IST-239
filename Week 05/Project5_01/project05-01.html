      This document, project05-01.html, is an HTML document that provides the basic functionality
      of the hands-on project. It includes the title of the project, Hands-On Project 5-1, the 
      instructions for the user of the completed web page, what the web page is supposed to be, 
      Algebra I Practice Quiz, along with a timer clock that counts down from 90. There is an 
      overlay covering the quiz contents and when the user selects the "Start Quiz" button, the
      overlay will be hidden so that the user can complete the quiz.
