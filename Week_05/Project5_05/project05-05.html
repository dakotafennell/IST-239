    This project file, project05-05.html, is the main HTML file for the Hands-On Project 5-5. This
    file contains the HTML code for the Concentration Game. This project is a simple matching tiles
    game. The game is played by clicking on any tile to flip it and show the image on its back. The
    games tiles are contained inside the div element with the id "board". Each tile, stored as a 
    div element with the ID, "tile", has two image elements, one with the class, "front" and the 
    other with the class, "back". The "front" image is the match picture and the "back" image is 
    the shown back of the tile. When the tiles "back" is clicked a function is called that moves 
    the "front" image to the visible layer and the "back" image to the hidden layer and moves the 
    "back" image to the invisible layer. The game ends when all tiles are matched. The game can be
    restarted by reloading the web page.
