          I started this blog in order to share my latest fiction with my
          readers and to post reviews and comments on the world of Science
          Fiction and Fantasy. From time to time, we'll have interviews with
          other great authors in the Sci-Fi and Fantasy markets as well as give
          you the inside scoop on upcoming conventions.

        <!-- Paragraph element (<p>) containing the short, story synopsis. -->
        <p>
          In Short: An engrossing novel of philosophy and hard science. Highly
          Recommended.
        </p>
        <!-- Paragraph element (<p>) containing the novels star rating -->
        <p>3 Stars</p>

        <!-- Paragraph element (<p>) that will contain the first paragraph of the review. -->
        <p>
          In her latest science-fiction novel, Yang explores the idea of quantum
          tunneling and a machine built to instantly transport the rider to the
          end of the universe. Teleportation is an old sci-fi concept and one
          that I thought had been wrung dry. Yang has proven me wrong.
          Reminiscent of the best of Niven's teleportation series stories from
          the 70's, Yang is concerned, not so much with the technology of
          teleportation, as much as its effect on society, morals, and religion.
        </p>

        <!-- Paragraph element (<p>) that will contain the second paragraph of the review. -->
        <p>
          To be sure, this is not just philosophical track masquerading as a SF
          novel (though Yang's always-fascinating philosophical ruminations are
          here in abundance). Fans of hard-hitting action-packed SF will have
          plenty to entertain them and Yang pulls several rabbits out of her hat
          to surprise any reader. I thought I knew all of the tricks of the
          trade and Yang's denouement surprised even me.
        </p>

        <!-- Paragraph element (<p>) that will contain the third paragraph of the review. -->
        <p>
          My only complaint is that the novel begins slowly with a bit too much
          emphasis on the technobabble associated with teleportation. Why do
          some authors insist on turning whole chapters into a physics thesis?
          However don't skip the second chapter or else you'll miss a hilarious
          misadventure involving two teleportation devices and a rather annoying
          cat.
        </p>

        <!-- Paragraph element (<p>) that will contain the fourth paragraph of the review. -->
        <p>
          Yang is the proud owner of both the Hugo and Nebula award for her
          novel, <em>Picasso's Timepiece</em>. Is a second Hugo/Nebula award
          sweep in the offing? It's still early, but Yang's latest work has to
          be considered a strong contender.
