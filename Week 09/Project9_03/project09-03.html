      This file, project09-03.html, is the main web page for the Hands-On Project 9-3. This page is a
      mock-up of a blog site that displays the title of the blog, SBLogger, the date of last visit,
      a basic introduction to the blog site, and three blog posts. The first blog post is titled, 
      Check that Pen!, the second blog post is titled, A Cheesy Monument, and the third blog post 
      is titled, Jenkins on Ice. Each blog post displays the date of the post, a blurb about the 
      post, and a link to the full post.
