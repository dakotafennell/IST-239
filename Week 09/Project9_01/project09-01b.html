      This file, project09-01b.html, is the second web page for the Hands-On Project 9-1. This page
      contains a shopping cart that will display the message entered by the user on the previous 
      page, project09-01a.html, inside of a table element (<table>) with the id, "greeting". The page
      will also display the total cost of the shopping cart in a separate table element with the 
      id, "order".
