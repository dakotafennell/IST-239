		This file, project11-03.html is the main webpage for the Hands-On Project 11-3. This project
		will retrieve customer orders from the fictional Wizard Works pyrotechnics company. This 
		project uses a Perl script file, wworder.pl, that is accessed by the project11-03.js file to
		create a table based on entering the user credentials of one of the two available users, 
		Rachel (RW301) and Bernard (BA684). When the user inputs the correct User ID and password
		combination, the JavaScript file (project11-03.js) fetches the JSON data stored within the
		Perl script file (wworders.pl) and displays it inside of a table created within the 
		"orderResult" div element.
