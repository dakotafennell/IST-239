      This file, project06-05.html, is the HTML file for the Hands-on Project 6-5. This web page is
      a registration page for a conference. The user can enter their information into the text boxes
      on the left side of the page and after selecting their session pack and banquet options, the 
      right side of the page will display the users entered information alongside the total cost of
      their registration. The user can then click the "Register" button to submit their information
      and be redirected to the formsubmit.html page.
