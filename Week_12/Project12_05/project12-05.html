		This file, project12-01.html, is one of the two HTML files for the Hands-On Project 12-5. 
      This project is a user account creation form that validates the user's input using jQuery.
      The project12-05.js file contains the jQuery code to validate the user's input but initially
      their are several errors in the code. The form uses the get method to send the form data to 
      the server. The action attribute is set to formsubmit.html to display the form data on the 
      web page in a table after submitting it. The form uses the required attribute to set the 
      fields as required.
