		This file, project12-01.html, is the HTML file for the Hands-On Project 12-1. This website is
      a simple website that is for a fictional sea life cruise company. The website has a dropdown
      menu that allows the user to select a cruise and then displays the information about the cruise
      in the main content area of the page. The website also has a footer that displays the name of
      the company and its location. The website uses jQuery code in the project12-01.js file to
      allow the dropdown menus to function.
