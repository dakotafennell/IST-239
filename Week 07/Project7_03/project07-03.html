        This file, project07-03.html, is the HTML file for the Hands-on Project 7-3. This project
        is a countdown timer that displays the users current time, and using the JavaScript source
        file, project07-03.js, calculates and displays the time remaining until the next new year.
        The next new year is set as January 1st, 2024, at 00:00:00. The current date and time is 
        displayed above the countdown timer and stored in the div element (<div>), "timeBox". This
        time is updated every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) and uses the user's local time. This 
        time is formatted as "MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS". The countdown timer is displayed below the
        current time and is formatted as "DD:HH:MM:SS". The timer is updated every 1000 milliseconds
        (1 second) and will display the time remaining until the next new year. The timer will
        display "00:00:00:00" when the new year has arrived.
