        This HTML file, project07-01.html, is a simple form for the user to enter their chosen 
        username and password. This file will call the JavaScript file, project07-01.js, to 
        validate the user's input. If the JavaScript file determines that the user's input is 
        valid, the form will be submitted and the user will be directed to the formsubmit.html
        file using the "get" method. If the JavaScript file determines that the user's input is
        invalid, the form will not be submitted and the user will be prompted to enter valid
        information.
